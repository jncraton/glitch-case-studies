# Case Studies from Video Game Glitches

## Abstract

This work explores the use of classic video game glitches as multifaceted case studies to demonstrate key concepts in computer science and cybersecurity. The ``Old Man Glitch'' from Pokémon Red is used and evaluated as a learning instrument in an undergraduate computer science course. The case study received strong positive qualitative feedback, suggesting its potential to enhance student engagement and promote active learning through the diagnosis and exploitation of software vulnerabilities.
