## Reviewer 1

- [ ] I greatly enjoyed reading this paper - and would have liked to hear more about the concepts in the paper, specifically how the glitch was introduced, and the specific situation it was used on (cyber security perhaps?)

- [ ] A pre-post test is mentioned in this paper, but I am curious was the test - and the general scores before and after. This data will be helpful in reflecting on the experience. Perhaps I am disconnected from the students, but I do wonder how much the original Pokémon is relevant to students in today's classrooms - it's almost 30 years old now.

## Reviewer 2

Suggested Improvements/Questions:

- [ ] I would like to see more discussion about the classroom and replicating this for other educators. While there is talk about how to get the game running, there is no real discussion on preparing students to understand the game itself, "Pokémon" and the core concepts needed to grasp why the glitch is significant. Perhaps this is not important, but that needs clarified.

- [ ] Similarly, the paper does not discuss any direction that the professor may give - are there direct questions that they are posing to the students? How much time is dedicated to this case study? I am interested in the specifics.

- [ ] Some of this could be ameliorated by having more discussion of "case studies" as teaching concept themselves in the "Theoretical Foundation" section.

- [x] Small quibble, but Pokémon should be spelled correctly, with the special character above the e.

## Reviewer 3

Overall well written with focused purpose appropriate for the conference; however some issues like incomplete explanations, particularly of the methodology employed and clarity in the gaming example. The paper starts out very strong with a very nice premise, but then seems a bit disorganized in the latter half.

Suggestions for improvement:

- [ ] 1. Abstract: Provide context for the last sentence. What were the post (vs. pre) test scores testing and what does strong qualitative feedback mean (assuming a positive context then?)

- [ ] 2. Introduction, paragraph 4: Define glitch in this context when concept first introduced.

- [ ] 3. Methodology, paragraph 2: Provide a couple brief examples of "various hardware tools and methods to accomplish this"

- [ ] 4. Methodology: The actual methodology is not clear. The paragraph provides information essentially on how the data will be acquired (i.e., the gaming glitch), but not what methods will be used and for what purpose. What happens or should happen after the gaming glitch is identified? What are the students going to do and what are the intended learning outcomes? The "Assessment" section---use the methodology section to set-up the information presented later with statistical testing.

- [ ] 5. Example Case (IMO---Glitch Case Study better title): Perhaps too rudimentary for this audience (?), but suggest providing 1-2 sentence context at the beginning of this section about the Pokémon game, how it runs/purpose, backstory, etc. Otherwise the subsequent paragraphs are a bit harder to follow if you are not intimately familiar with this game. More modern Pokémon GO seem more familiar yet distinctly different than this retro system.

- [ ] 6. Example Case, p. 4, third paragraph: Discuss the meaning behind "defense in depth"

- [ ] 7. Example Case, p. 4, last paragraph: Again, if you have never played the game, then an "inventory to be set to 128" has no meaning. Provide context here.

- [ ] 8. Assessment: What is the sample size? Are the paired samples t-test appropriate given the sample size, normally distributed? If not, was a non-parametric test like Wilcoxon Rank Sum used? Statistical significance is stated but the methodology should state what threshold that is determined at and what hypothesis is being tested. Based on information presented the results are barely significant at the 95% confidence level. It is also very unclear what was being tested. What was the assessment question(s)?

- [ ] 9. References: Might include a couple more references from the past decade.
